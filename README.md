# Pewlitt-Hackard Employee Database Manipulation

The code in this repository was written to pull the csv data from Pewlitt Hackard's employee data from the 80s and 90s into tables in a PostgreSQL database. The data was then queried to filter for more specific data and to amalgamate the data into single tables where the data may not have been together.

# Methods

- Create Entity Relational Diagram (ERD)
- Create tables
  - Define variables, primary keys, and foreign keys
- Write queries to filter tables for the desired columns and variables
